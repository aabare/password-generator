# Password Generator Starter Code
Password Generator

Introduction

The password generator was created for Challenge 3 and includes the JavaScript and HTML files. The password generator creates a randomized password that will include: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. The user will choose the length of the password between 8 and 128. The generator will take all the selected characters and create a unique password.

Usage 

Once on the password generator the user will be able to generate a random password. The user will click the “Generate” button,and then will be prompted to enter a length of their password between the defined value of 8 and 128. After that, the user will be asked a series of questions about what they would like to include in their password. The user will be asked if they would like to have uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers or special characters. This will produce a randomized version of the selected characteristics.
